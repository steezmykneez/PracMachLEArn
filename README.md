## Practical Machine Learning: Course project


This repository contains the R code and the documentation of the final course project of the MOOC [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn) on Coursera.

The task was to predict the type of barbell lift based on data from several accelerometers.

The file [`writeup.md`](https://github.com/hohenstein/machine-learning/blob/master/writeup.md) contains a description of the task and the machine-learning process with *Random Forests* together with the results.

The corresponding R commands can be found in the RMarkdown file [`writeup.Rmd`](https://github.com/hohenstein/machine-learning/blob/master/writeup.Rmd).
